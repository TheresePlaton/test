C++ project. Qt based snake game.

A programming project was chosen as the assignment for the final assessment in the C++ course during spring semester 2017 
at Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences(HiOA). This project was to reflect the contents of the course, 
show student's understanding of the subject and the ability to apply theoretical aspects of C++ programming language in a practical
assignment. Several ideas were discussed by the group as to what kind of project would be best suited for the task at hand.
As a result, a game developing project was chosen by the group, as game development project ties together programming languages 
and problem solving.

How to play.

When you start the application, in the upper right corner you can choose to look at the instructrions of the game, and 
the rules of the game. The game starts with the score of 0, and at level 1. The progressbar helps you to keep a visual track 
of how far you are into the game, and how close you are to reach the next level.
You must press the startbutton to start the game. While playing you use the arrow keys on the keyboard. Once you start
playing you can pause the game, by pressing the pause button, or by pressing the space key on your keyboard.

Snake takes the colors of the powerups it has eaten. And that the progressbar is showing how far into the game the player is. 

For the purpose of demonstration for this project, two levels are designed. 

When the game ends or a player looses, a game over dialogue is prompted. User can enter name and users high score displays. If current
high score is in the top ten, it will be displayed on scoreboard.
